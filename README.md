- **Features**: Job discovery, skills matching, application tracking, file management

### 🏗️ Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: Modern React with Next.js App Router
- **Backend Integration**: RESTful API consumption with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand for predictable state updates
- **Styling**: Utility-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control (Talent/Recruiter)
- **File Handling**: Drag-and-drop uploads with validation

## Major Learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering Program

### Key Technologies Covered
- **Frontend Frameworks**: Next.js, React
- **Styling Solutions**: TailwindCSS, Responsive Design
- **Programming Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
- **State Management**: Zustand, React Context
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs, Error Handling
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, Git, Vercel
- **Mobile Development**: Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- **System Design**: Component Architecture, Performance Optimization

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

#### Technical Challenges
- **Challenge:** Complex state management across multiple user roles (talent vs recruiter)
  **Solution:** Implemented Zustand stores with role-based state separation and custom hooks for clean component integration.

- **Challenge:** Responsive file upload component with drag-and-drop functionality
  **Solution:** Built custom FileUpload component with validation, progress tracking, and mobile-optimized responsive design.

- **Challenge:** Skills matching algorithm and real-time percentage calculation
  **Solution:** Created efficient comparison algorithm using array methods and implemented caching for performance optimization.

#### Integration Challenges
- **Challenge:** Integrating APIs from backend with inconsistent response formats
  **Solution:** Implemented robust type guards, union types for mixed API responses, and comprehensive error handling middleware.

- **Challenge:** Real-time activity feed with pagination and performance optimization
  **Solution:** Built cursor-based pagination system with efficient caching and background data fetching.

#### UI/UX Challenges
- **Challenge:** Maintaining design consistency across 12+ pages and components
  **Solution:** Created comprehensive design system with reusable UI components and Tailwind CSS utility classes.

- **Challenge:** Cross-device responsiveness and mobile-first design
  **Solution:** Implemented mobile-first responsive design patterns with breakpoint-specific component variants.

### Best Practices and Personal Takeaways

#### Code Quality
- Prioritize component reusability and clean code architecture
- Use TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries and loading states
- Follow consistent naming conventions and file organization

#### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading and code splitting strategies
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Use efficient state updates and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper caching strategies for API calls

#### Collaboration & Development
- Maintain clear communication with backend collaborators
- Document API integrations and component interfaces
- Use Git best practices with descriptive commit messages
- Test features incrementally and gather user feedback early

#### Production Deployment
- Configure proper build optimization and environment variables
- Implement proper error monitoring and logging
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Ensure security best practices for authentication and data handling
